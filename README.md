Hi there!
I am looking forward to learning new things as I share my work!
My favourite language as of now is C++

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    bool Like;
    cout << "Type 1 if you like my page, or 0 if you don't\n";
    cin >> Like;
    if(Like)
      cout << "Thank you, you are awesome!";
    else
      cout << "Better luck next time, i guess!";
      return 0;
}
